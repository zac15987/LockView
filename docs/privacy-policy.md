# Privacy Policy for Lock View

**Last Updated:** January 28, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Lock View ("we", "our", or "the app") handles user information. Lock View is an open-source Android application developed by zac15987 that provides a lockable image viewer with advanced gesture controls.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Lock View is designed with privacy in mind and collects no personal information whatsoever.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Lock View does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Specifically, we do not collect:

- Personal identifiers (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Location data
- Usage analytics or statistics
- Crash reports or diagnostic data
- Photos or media metadata
- Any data through third-party services

## Local Data Storage

Lock View stores the following data locally on your device only:

- **Theme Preference**: Your choice of light, dark, or system theme
- **Language Preference**: Your selected display language (English, Traditional Chinese, or System default)

This data is stored using Android's DataStore and SharedPreferences, remains on your device, and is never transmitted to any external servers.

## Permissions

Lock View requires the following permissions to function:

### Storage Permissions
- **READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** (Android 12 and below)
- **READ_MEDIA_IMAGES** (Android 13 and above)

These permissions are used solely to allow you to select and view images from your device's storage. Lock View:
- Only accesses images you explicitly select
- Does not scan or index your photo library
- Does not access image metadata or EXIF data
- Does not modify or delete any files

## Data Sharing

Lock View does not share any data with third parties. We do not use:
- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Social media integrations
- Cloud storage services
- Any external APIs or services

## Security

Your privacy and security are our top priorities:
- All app data remains locally on your device
- No network connections are established by the app
- No data is transmitted over the internet
- The app's source code is publicly available on GitHub for transparency and security auditing

## Children's Privacy

Lock View does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. The app does not collect any personal information from users of any age.

## Open Source Transparency

Lock View is an open-source application. Our complete source code is available on GitHub, allowing anyone to verify our privacy practices and ensure that the app functions exactly as described in this privacy policy.

## Future Updates

While Lock View currently collects no data, we may consider adding optional crash reporting functionality in future updates to improve app stability. If we implement such features:
- They will be completely optional and require explicit user consent
- We will update this privacy policy accordingly
- Users will be notified of any significant changes

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. For significant changes, we will provide a more prominent notice within the app.
