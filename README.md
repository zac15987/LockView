An Android image viewer with lock functionality, gesture controls, and automatic device-unlock integration that prevents accidental interactions.

*Built in collaboration with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)* 

## Motivation for Development

When entering a client's factory for work, a digital contractor ID (an image) is required for access. The process involves opening the contractor ID image, handing the phone to the security guard to scan the barcode on the image, and then having a security sticker applied to the phone's camera. During this procedure, the phone is often accidentally touched, sometimes nearly resulting in the deletion of the contractor ID image or the exposure of personal photos. These issues occur due to accidental gestures triggering the back function or pressing buttons unintentionally. This led to the decision to develop this application, which has successfully resolved this troublesome issue.

- JDK 11 or higher
- Android SDK with API 36

### Architecture
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVVM with Repository pattern
- **State Management**: StateFlow and Compose state
- **Dependency Injection**: Manual DI with ViewModel factories
- **Data Persistence**: DataStore Preferences

### Building
```bash
# Windows/WSL
cmd.exe /c "gradlew assembleDebug"     # Debug build
cmd.exe /c "gradlew assembleRelease"   # Release build

# Mac/Linux
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Signing Configuration

For release builds, you'll need to configure signing:

1. Copy `keystore.properties.template` to `keystore.properties`:
   ```bash
   cp keystore.properties.template keystore.properties
   ```

2. Edit `keystore.properties` with your signing information:
   ```properties
   storePassword=your_keystore_password
   keyPassword=your_key_password
   keyAlias=your_key_alias
   storeFile=path/to/your/keystore.keystore
   ```

3. Place your keystore file in the specified location

**Important**: Never commit `keystore.properties` or your `.keystore` files to version control. These files are already added to `.gitignore` for security.

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
cmd.exe /c "gradlew test"

# Run lint checks
cmd.exe /c "gradlew lint"
```
